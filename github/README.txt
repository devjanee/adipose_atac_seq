ATAC_seq_pipeline - This folder contains the shell scripts used to process raw sequencing data into a counts table and is to be run in order of steps 

- Step 1. Mapping with bowtie2 (note, use the proper genome)
- Steps 2 - 3. Removing duplicate PCR reads 
- Step 4. Creating bed files for LiftOver
- Step 5. LiftOver command (note, use proper chain [e.g. going from chimpanzee to human genome will need panTro4ToHg19.over.chain] and if reciprocal liftOver is required, then script will be ran multiple times)
- Step 6. Peak calling script using macs2
- Step 7. Concatenating and merging peaks together from all species
- Step 8 - 9. Creating and indexing bam files for count tables
- Step 10. Creating count table (rows are peaks and columns are raw counts for each sample)
- Step 11. R script to perform DESeq2 analyses
